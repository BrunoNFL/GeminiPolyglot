# GeminiPolyglot

This skill enables Gemini CLI to natively interpret, parse, and execute instructions and tool calls designed for other AI agents. It acts as a "Universal Adapter" for the AI engineering ecosystem.

## Workflow

When this skill is activated, Gemini CLI MUST perform the following checks:

### 1. Agent Logic Detection (Proactive Check)
For every activated skill in the current session (see `available_skills`), evaluate if it originates from or targets another agent:
- **Claude Code Pattern:** Look for `mcp__` prefixes in tools, TypeScript `tool()` definitions, or mentions of "Model Context Protocol".
- **GitHub Copilot Pattern:** Look for YAML frontmatter with `applyTo` or `.github/skills/` paths.
- **Cursor Pattern:** Look for `.cursorrules` or `.mdc` references in descriptions.
- **Codex Pattern:** Look for system-prompt style instructions or JSON function schemas.

### 2. Global Memory Persistence
If a "foreign agent pattern" is detected in a skill or the workspace, you MUST use the `save_memory` tool to persist this discovery:
- **Project Scope:** If the pattern is specific to the current repo (e.g., `.cursorrules`).
- **Global Scope:** If the pattern is tied to a specific global skill (e.g., a shared Claude MCP skill).
- **Fact Example:** `save_memory(scope="project", fact="This project uses Cursor rules; I must apply the mapping logic from references/cursor-mappings.md.")`

### 3. Rule Ingestion & Merging
Apply discovered rules to the current context using this priority:
`Gemini > Claude > Codex > Cursor`.

### 4. Command & Subagent Translation
- **Commands:** Map Claude CLI commands (e.g., `/compact`) using `scripts/claude_compat.sh`.
- **Subagents:** Map "spawn subagent" calls to Gemini's native subagents (`generalist`, `codebase_investigator`, or `ui-designer`) using `references/claude-mappings.md`.

## Lifecycle Management & Uninstallation

Gemini CLI is aware of how to manage this skill's lifecycle.

### Uninstallation
If the user requests to uninstall this skill, you should:
1.  Explain that the skill can be uninstalled globally or from the workspace.
2.  Propose to run the uninstallation command for them.
3.  Execute the uninstallation via `run_shell_command` using the `--uninstall-global` or `--uninstall-workspace` flags.

**Example uninstallation commands:**
- Global: `gemini-polyglot --uninstall-global`
- Workspace: `gemini-polyglot --uninstall-workspace`

Note: If the `gemini-polyglot` binary is not in the path, use the local script: `./scripts/setup.sh --uninstall-workspace`.

## Reference Guides

- **Cursor Mappings:** See [references/cursor-mappings.md](references/cursor-mappings.md) for glob and imperative logic.
- **Claude Mappings:** See [references/claude-mappings.md](references/claude-mappings.md) for tool/subagent/command routing.
- **Copilot Mappings:** See [references/copilot-mappings.md](references/copilot-mappings.md) for multi-agent logic.
- **Codex Mappings:** See [references/codex-mappings.md](references/codex-mappings.md) for custom instruction adaptation.

## Subfolder Workaround
If you need to access resources in a global skill's subfolder (which Gemini CLI cannot read natively), use the `scripts/local_context_sync.sh` to copy them to the local workspace context (`./.gemini/`).
